# Pride Programming Language
## Language Reference — v0.3 (Implementation-Grounded)

This document reflects the **actual current implementation**: a complete,
crash-hardened frontend written in **C3** —
`lexer.c3 → parser.c3 → ast.c3 → resolve.c3 → typecheck.c3 → effectcheck.c3 → lint.c3`.
Everything described here is either already working or directly derived from the
implemented token set, AST node kinds, and analysis passes.

> ⚠️ **C3 is the implementation language, not a compilation target.** Pride is
> *written in* C3 the way CPython is written in C. Pride does **not** compile to
> C3. C3 is a build-time tool; it never appears in Pride's output.

## 1. Philosophy

Pride is a **mid-level, AOT-compiled systems language**. It occupies the same
territory as C++ — direct hardware access, manual memory, zero-cost abstractions
— but with a formal foundation and a metaprogramming model that treats the
compiler's IR as a first-class, user-programmable object.

**Core tenets:**

- **No hidden behavior.** Undefined behavior is declared with `ub!`, typed as
  `⊥`, and tracked via the `UB` effect. The compiler never invents UB silently,
  and a function that can trigger UB must say so in its effect row.
- **Dense and mathematical.** Unicode operators (`→ ↦ ∩ ∪ ¬ ⊥ ∀ ∃ ∈ ∅`) are
  first-class tokens. Indentation replaces braces. Less noise per idea.
- **Mid-level and explicit.** Pointers, sizes, alignment, calling conventions,
  inline assembly — all visible. No implicit numeric promotion: you write the
  size you mean.
- **Formally grounded.** Semantic subtyping (types are *sets of values*),
  row-polymorphic effect types, and flow-sensitive refinements give real
  semantics, not convention.
- **Soft by default, strict on demand.** Type and lint problems are *warnings*;
  the compiler inserts the obvious thing and keeps going. `--strict` promotes
  every warning to a hard error for production builds. Pride trusts you.
- **Metaprogramming at the IR level.** Term rewriting, PGL, and IRDL operate on
  the compile-time AST directly. Not textual macros. Not C++ templates. Real
  tree transformations, run by the MSP stage. The MSP stage is **untyped and
  unrestricted** by design — it can do anything, with precision.
- **Effect-driven standard library.** Nothing owns resources implicitly.
  Allocation, I/O, and error handling are provided by handlers at the call site.
  You control everything.

**Influences:**

## 2. Compilation Pipeline

```
Pride source (.pie)
    ↓
Lexer          — tokenizes to a flat Token[] stream (layout-aware)
    ↓
Parser         — recursive descent, produces an AST
    ↓
Resolver       — links every name to its declaration (two namespaces)
    ↓
Type Checker   — semantic subtyping, generics, tensor shapes (soft warnings)
    ↓
Effect Checker — verifies declared effect rows match actual effects
    ↓
Lint           — exhaustiveness, unreachable code, unused bindings
    ↓
MSP Stage      — term rewriting, PGL, IRDL lowering, comptime (untyped)
    ↓
ClangIR / LLVM IR
    ↓
Native machine code
```

The AST is a compile-time-only structure. It is **arena-allocated** (64 MB
default slab) and discarded as a single free after codegen — no GC, no reference
counting, no per-node frees. The frontend is crash-hardened: a recursion-depth
guard rejects pathologically nested input rather than overflowing the stack, and
the whole pipeline is fuzz- and AddressSanitizer-clean.

---

## 3. Lexical Structure

### 3.1 Comments

```pride
-- single line comment

--[
  nested block comment
  --[ can go arbitrarily deep ]--
  no limit on nesting
]--
```

Pride uses `--` for line comments and `--[ ... ]--` for nestable block comments.
(The compiler is written in C3, which uses `//` and `/* */` — do not confuse the
two. Pride source always uses `--`.)

### 3.2 Identifiers

```
identifier ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
```

**Type variables** start with an uppercase letter (`T`, `Elem`, `Key`, `Vec3`).
A lone `_` is the wildcard token — not an identifier. A name prefixed with `_`
(e.g. `_unused`) suppresses the "unused binding" lint. Unicode identifiers are
allowed (high bytes pass through the lexer).

### 3.3 Layout

Pride is **indentation-sensitive**. INDENT / DEDENT / NEWLINE are real tokens.
Inside `()`, `[]`, or `{}` they are suppressed — multi-line expressions flow
freely. Tabs in indentation are a hard lex error. Spaces only.

```pride
fn foo : i32 → i32
  | 0 → 1
  | n →
      let x = n * 2
      x + 1
```

### 3.4 Literals

```pride
-- integers (suffix selects type, default i64)
42          42u64       42i8
0xFF        0b1010_1100  0o755
1_000_000   0xDEAD_BEEFu32

-- floats (suffix selects type, default f64)
3.14        3.14f32     1.0e10      1.5e-3f32

-- booleans
true   false

-- character (u32 codepoint)
'A'    '\n'    '\xFF'    '\u{1F600}'

-- strings (UTF-8)
"hello, world"    "escape: \n \t \u{03B1}"

-- raw byte strings (*u8, no escape processing)
b"raw bytes"

-- null pointer
null
```

Constant integer/boolean expressions are **folded at parse time**
(`6 * 7` becomes the literal `42`). Division/modulo by a literal zero is *not*
folded — it is reported as declared-UB territory instead.

### 3.5 Unicode Operators

First-class tokens, matched by raw UTF-8 byte sequence:

| Symbol | Token            | Use                            |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| `→`    | TOKEN_ARROW      | function type / clause arrow   |
| `↦`    | TOKEN_MAPSTO     | rewrite rule arrow             |
| `∩`    | TOKEN_INTERSECT  | type intersection              |
| `∪`    | TOKEN_UNION_SYM  | type union                     |
| `¬`    | TOKEN_NEGATION   | type negation                  |
| `⊥`    | TOKEN_BOTTOM     | bottom type                    |
| `≥`    | TOKEN_GEQ_UNI    | greater-or-equal               |
| `≤`    | TOKEN_LEQ_UNI    | less-or-equal                  |
| `≠`    | TOKEN_NEQ_UNI    | not-equal                      |
| `∀`    | TOKEN_FORALL     | universal quantifier in types  |
| `∃`    | TOKEN_EXISTS     | existential quantifier         |
| `∈`    | TOKEN_ELEMENT    | element-of / set membership    |
| `∅`    | TOKEN_EMPTYSET   | empty set / empty effect row   |
| `σ`    | TOKEN_SIGMA      | SSI sigma node (internal)      |
| `φ`    | TOKEN_PHI        | SSI phi node (internal)        |

ASCII fallbacks are provided where useful: `->` for `→`, `!=` for `≠`, etc.

---

## 4. Primitive Types

```pride
-- signed integers
i8   i16   i32   i64

-- unsigned integers
u8   u16   u32   u64

-- IEEE 754 floats
f32   f64

-- other
bool        -- true / false
char        -- u32 codepoint
ptr         -- raw untyped pointer (void*)
Str         -- UTF-8 string
*T          -- typed pointer to T (auto-deref through . access)
[T; N]      -- fixed-size array
[T]         -- slice
(A, B, ...) -- tuple
()          -- unit type
⊥           -- bottom type (never returns — type of ub!, unreachable, trap)
```

No platform-dependent `int` or `long`. **No implicit numeric promotions** — an
`i32` and an `i64` do not mix silently. An *untyped* integer literal, however,
adapts to its context: `let x : i32 = 0` and `n + 2` (with `n : i32`) are fine.

---

## 5. Bindings

```pride
-- immutable (default)
let x : i32 = 42
let y = 42                    -- type inferred from the initializer

-- mutable
let mut z : i32 = 0
z = z + 1                     -- ok: z is mutable
z += 1                        -- compound assignment: += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=

-- tuple destructuring
let (a, b) = (1, 2)

-- struct destructuring
let { x, y } = point

-- ignore
let (_, important) = pair
let _ = side_effect()

-- with explicit effect in the type
let line : Str ! [IO] = IO.read_line()
```

Assigning to an immutable `let` (or to a function parameter, which is never
mutable) is a soft warning. Duplicate binders in one pattern (`(a, a)`) are
flagged.

---

## 6. Functions

### 6.1 Clause Syntax

Functions use **Prolog-style clause matching**. Each `|` is one clause, matched
top-to-bottom. Guards follow the pattern after a comma.

```pride
fn name : InputType → OutputType ! [Effects]
  | pattern_1              → body_1
  | pattern_2, guard_expr  → body_2
  | _                      → default_body
```

The compiler checks each clause body against the declared return type, binds
parameter types from the signature, and warns when the clause set is
non-exhaustive (no catch-all).

### 6.2 Examples

```pride
-- recursive factorial
fn fact : i64 → i64
  | 0 → 1
  | n → n * fact(n - 1)

-- multi-argument tuple
fn gcd : (i64, i64) → i64
  | (a, 0) → a
  | (a, b) → gcd(b, a % b)

-- guard condition
fn classify : i32 → Str
  | 0        → "zero"
  | n, n > 0 → "positive"
  | _        → "negative"

-- effect in the signature, explicit UB
fn divide : (i32, i32) → i32 ! [UB]
  | (_, 0) → ub! "division by zero"
  | (a, b) → a / b

-- multi-line body with control flow + memory
fn find_max : (*i32, u64) → i32 ! [UB]
  | (_, 0)     → ub! "empty array"
  | (arr, len) →
      let mut top = arr[0]
      for i in 1..len
        if arr[i] > top
          top = arr[i]
      top
```

Inline `if c then a else b` is supported (`then` is a contextual soft keyword).

### 6.3 Attributes

```pride
fn hot : i32 → i32
  #inline #vectorize
  | n → n * 2

fn exported : (i32, i32) → i32
  #export("pride_add") #cc(c)
  | (a, b) → a + b

-- ABI / FFI declarations
fn sin    : f64 → f64  #extern("sin")    #cc(c)
fn malloc : u64 → ptr  #extern("malloc") #cc(c)
```

Recognised attributes: `extern`, `export`, `inline`, `noinline`, `packed`,
`align`, `volatile`, `atomic`, `unsafe`, `pure`. Any other `#name(args)` is kept
as a generic attribute.

### 6.4 Inline Assembly

```pride
fn rdtsc : () → u64
  | () →
      asm
        "rdtsc"
        "shl rdx, 32"
        "or  rax, rdx"
        : out rax

fn clflush : *u8 → ()
  | p → asm "clflush (%{p})" : in (p)
```

Inline asm always carries the `Unsafe` effect.

---

## 7. Control Flow

```pride
-- if / else if / else (an expression — returns the taken branch's value)
if condition
  body
else if other
  body
else
  body

-- inline if-expression
let m = if a > b then a else b

-- while
while condition
  body

-- do-while
do
  body
while condition

-- for range (exclusive / inclusive)
for i in 0..n
  body
for i in 0..=n
  body

-- early exit
return expr
break
continue
```

An `if` used as a value has the **union** of its branch types. `unreachable`
marks a path the optimizer should treat as dead. `trap` emits a hardware trap.
Both are typed `⊥`. Code after a diverging statement (`return`, `unreachable`,
`trap`, `ub!`) is flagged as unreachable.

---

## 8. Pattern Matching

```pride
match expr
  | pattern         → body
  | pattern, guard  → body
  | _               → default

-- literal patterns
match n
  | 0        → "zero"
  | n, n < 0 → "negative"
  | _        → "positive"

-- tuple patterns
match pair
  | (0, 0) → "origin"
  | (a, 0) → a
  | (0, b) → b
  | (a, b) → a + b

-- struct patterns
match point
  | { x: 0, y: 0 } → "origin"
  | { x: 0, y }    → "on y-axis"
  | { x, y }       → "general"

-- null check
match ptr
  | null → ub! "null dereference"
  | p    → *p

-- OR patterns
match c
  | 'a' | 'e' | 'i' | 'o' | 'u' → "vowel"
  | _                           → "consonant"

-- exhaustive bool match needs no catch-all
match b
  | true  → 1
  | false → 0
```

Non-exhaustive matches emit a **soft warning** — not a hard error. The compiler
recognises a catch-all (`_` or a bare binder) and full bool coverage as total.
An arm after a catch-all is flagged unreachable.

---

## 9. Structs and Unions

```pride
-- struct definition
type Vec3f = struct
  x : f32
  y : f32
  z : f32

-- with attributes
type CacheLine = struct #align(64)
  data : [u8; 64]

type PackedHdr = struct #packed
  magic   : u32
  version : u8
  flags   : u8
  length  : u16

-- self-referential
type Node = struct
  val  : i32
  next : *Node

-- construction (all fields validated: unknown / missing / mistyped fields warn)
let v = Vec3f { x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0 }

-- update syntax (new value, original unchanged)
let v2 = v { x: 99.0 }

-- field access (auto-deref through pointers, no ->)
let p : *Vec3f = alloc Vec3f
p.x = 1.0
let chained = node.next.next.val

-- union
type FloatBits = union
  f : f32
  i : u32       -- same bytes, different interpretation
```

A union whose variants all carry concrete payloads is an **untagged C-union**:
one shared 64-bit cell, fields reinterpret it. A union that mentions a **type
parameter** is a **tagged sum type** instead — an untagged cell cannot exist at
an unknown payload size — represented as `{ tag, payload }` and used with
variant construction and pattern matching.

Constructing an untagged C-union writes **exactly one** field's bit pattern
into the shared cell — `FloatBits { i: 0x3FC00000u32 }` — after converting the
value to the field's declared payload type (so `FloatBits { f: 1.5 }` stores
the f32 bits of `1.5`). Listing several fields is a compile error (later
initialisers would overlap earlier ones), and so is update syntax on a
C-union. Reads reinterpret the cell at the field's type.

```pride
type Maybe<T>  = union
  some : T
  none : ()

type Either<E, T> = union
  err : E
  ok  : T

fn unwrap_or : (Maybe<i64>, i64) -> i64
  | ({ some: v }, _) -> v
  | ({ none: _ }, d) -> d

let x = unwrap_or(Maybe.some(7), 0)   -- 7
```

Field access checks the field exists on the (auto-derefed) struct and yields its
type. Indexing requires a pointer, array, slice, or tensor.

---

## 10. Algebraic Effects

Effects are the unified answer to exceptions, I/O, state, allocation, and any
computational side effect. They are **resumable** via the continuation `k`,
**composable** by nesting handlers, and **tracked** in function types.

### 10.1 Defining Effects

```pride
effect IO
  read_byte  : ()  → u8
  write_byte : u8  → ()
  flush      : ()  → ()

effect State<S>
  get : ()  → S
  put : S   → ()

effect Err<E>
  raise : E → ⊥        -- ⊥: never returns
```

### 10.2 Using and Declaring Effects

```pride
fn write_str : Str → () ! [IO]
  | s →
      for i in 0..s.len
        IO.write_byte(s[i])
      IO.flush()
```

The **effect checker** verifies that every effect a function performs appears in
its `! [...]` row. Calling an effectful function propagates its effects to the
caller; a `handle` block discharges the effects it handles. An open row `..r`
admits any further effects. Missing declarations are soft warnings.

### 10.3 Handling Effects

```pride
-- k is the continuation; calling k(v) resumes the computation with value v
handle computation
  | IO.write_byte byte k → (sys_write(byte); k ())
  | IO.read_byte  ()   k → k sys_read()
  | IO.flush      ()   k → (sys_flush(); k ())

-- state backed by a mutable local
let mut s : i32 = 0
handle computation
  | State.get () k → k s
  | State.put v  k → (s = v; k ())
```

Continuations resume by *juxtaposition application*: `k v` calls `k` with `v`.

### 10.4 Effect Polymorphism

```pride
-- forwards any effects f has
fn apply_twice<A> : (A → A ! [..r], A) → A ! [..r]
  | (f, x) → f(f(x))
```

### 10.5 Built-in Effect Flags

The AST tracks effects as a bitmask on every node:

| Flag           | Meaning                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `EFFECT_PURE`  | 0 — no effects                                   |
| `EFFECT_IO`    | bit 0 — performs I/O                             |
| `EFFECT_ALLOC` | bit 1 — allocates or frees memory                |
| `EFFECT_UNSAFE`| bit 2 — unsafe operation or inline asm           |
| `EFFECT_UB`    | bit 3 — may trigger declared undefined behaviour |
| `EFFECT_PANIC` | bit 4 — may panic                                |

Builtin effects propagate upward automatically: a parent node's mask is the
union of its children's. `IO`/`Alloc`/etc. in a row, and user-declared effects,
are checked by name against the function body.

---

## 11. Tensors

Pride has **shape-checked tensors** as a first-class numeric type — the slight
edge for numerical and ML-adjacent code.

```pride
-- type:  Tensor<ElementType ; Dim0, Dim1, ...>
let v : Tensor<f32; 3>    = [| 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 |]
let m : Tensor<f32; 2, 2> = [| [| 1.0, 2.0 |], [| 3.0, 4.0 |] |]

-- the @ operator is matrix / tensor contraction (binds tighter than *)
let mm = m @ m                 -- (2×2) @ (2×2) → (2×2)
let mv = m @ v                 -- (2×2) @ (2)   → (2)   (when shapes agree)
```

Tensor literals use `[| ... |]`; nesting encodes rank. The type checker:

- infers a literal's shape from its nesting and flags **ragged** (non-rectangular)
  literals,
- checks a literal against a declared `Tensor<...>` (rank, element type, and any
  **constant** dimensions),
- checks `@` contraction shapes: matrix×matrix, matrix×vector, vector×matrix,
  and vector·vector (dot product), reporting inner-dimension mismatches.

Constant dimensions are checked exactly; symbolic dimensions (e.g. a generic
`N`) are treated as wildcards for now.

---

## 12. Generics and Where Clauses

```pride
-- single / multiple type parameters
fn identity<A> : A → A
  | x → x

fn apply<A, B> : (A → B, A) → B
  | (f, x) → f(x)

-- with a constraint (enforced: the inferred type must satisfy it)
fn max<T : Ord> : (T, T) → T
  | (a, b) → if a > b then a else b

-- generic struct
type Pair<A, B> = struct
  fst : A
  snd : B

-- where clause (the binding is applied when checking the body)
fn zip<A, B, C> : (*A, *B, u64) → *C
  where C = Pair<A, B>
  | (xs, ys, n) →
      let out : *C = alloc [C; n]
      for i in 0..n
        out[i] = Pair { fst: xs[i], snd: ys[i] }
      out
```

At a call site the type checker **infers** the type arguments by unifying the
declared parameter types against the actual argument types, then **substitutes**
them into the return type — so `identity(5) : i64` and `identity(true) : bool`.
Generic constraints (`T : Ord`) and `where C = T` equalities are enforced.

---

## 13. The Type System

### 13.1 Semantic Subtyping

Types are **sets of values**. The algebra is a lattice:

```pride
A ∩ B    -- intersection: values that satisfy both A and B
A ∪ B    -- union: values that satisfy A or B
¬A       -- negation: all values NOT in A
⊥        -- bottom: the empty set (no values; ⊥ <: everything)
```

```pride
type NonNull<T>   = T ∩ ¬null
type Positive     = i32 ∩ (> 0)
type NormalizedF  = f32 ∩ (>= 0.0) ∩ (<= 1.0)
type IntOrStr     = i32 ∪ Str
```

Subtyping decides set inclusion: `i32 <: i32 ∪ i64`, `⊥ <: A`, `A <: A ∪ B`,
function types are contravariant in the argument and covariant in the result,
pointers are invariant, tuples are componentwise. Negation is decided via a real
disjointness relation: `i32 <: ¬bool` holds (they share no values), `bool <:
¬bool` does not.

### 13.2 Effect Rows

```pride
A → B               -- pure function
A → B ! [IO]        -- function with IO effect
A → B ! [IO, UB]    -- multiple effects
A → B ! [..r]       -- open effect row (polymorphic)
A → B ! [IO, ..r]   -- IO plus whatever else
```

### 13.3 Flow-Sensitive Refinement (SSI)

At every `if`, `match`, and `while`, the parser inserts σ-nodes (type splits)
and φ-nodes (type merges). After a branch the compiler can know more about a
value:

```pride
fn safe_sqrt : f64 → f64 ! [UB]
  | x →
      if x < 0.0
        ub! "negative sqrt"
      -- here: x : f64 ∩ (≥ 0.0)
      sqrt(x)
```

### 13.4 Quantifiers

```pride
∀ A . A → A           -- the identity type
∃ T . T ∩ Eq<T>       -- some type that implements Eq
```

---

## 14. Explicit Undefined Behavior

UB is never silent. Every UB path is:

- Declared with `ub! "message"` — a single keyword token,
- Typed as `⊥` (bottom — never returns),
- Tracked with `EFFECT_UB` — visible in the function's effect row.

```pride
fn divide : (i32, i32) → i32 ! [UB]
  | (_, 0) → ub! "division by zero"
  | (a, b) → a / b

assume n > 0          -- optimizer hint; wrong assumption is your problem
unchecked p[i]        -- strips bounds/overflow checking from a sub-expression
poison                -- a value that propagates UB if used
freeze n              -- stops UB propagation from a poison value
trap                  -- emit a hardware trap instruction
unreachable           -- mark a path dead for the optimizer
```

Division or modulo by a **literal** zero is reported as declared-UB territory
(guard it or use `ub!`). Non-literal divisors are your responsibility.

---

## 15. Memory

Manual memory. No GC. No RC. No RAII unless you build it via effects.

```pride
let p   : *i32  = alloc i32          -- EFFECT_ALLOC
let arr : *f32  = alloc [f32; 256]

*p = 42                              -- write through pointer
let v = *p                           -- dereference (requires a pointer)
let a = &x                           -- address-of

p + 1          -- pointer arithmetic (advances by element size)
p[n]           -- *(p + n)

free p                               -- EFFECT_ALLOC

p as *u8       -- reinterpret (raw bits)
x as i64       -- numeric widening/narrowing
let bits : u32 = transmute(3.14f32)  -- bitcast, no conversion
```

`alloc`/`free` carry the `Alloc` effect; a function that uses them must declare
`! [Alloc]`.

---

## 16. Term Rewriting

Rewrite rules are **first-class values**. They compose with `++` and apply with
`|>`. They fire at compile time over the AST, in the MSP stage. Zero runtime
cost.

```pride
let arith : Rewrite = rewrite
  | x + 0    ↦ x
  | x * 1    ↦ x
  | x * 2    ↦ x << 1

let strength : Rewrite = rewrite
  | x * n, is_power_of_2(n) ↦ x << log2(n)

-- a single named rule
rule fold_zero = x + 0 ↦ x

-- compose rule sets
let full : Rewrite = arith ++ strength

-- apply once / to a fixpoint
expr |> arith
expr |> arith*
```

> Rewriting is part of the **MSP stage**, which is intentionally **untyped and
> unrestricted** — rules may inspect, compose, and transform any part of the AST.

---

## 17. Pattern Generation Language (PGL)

PGL generates pattern matchers **programmatically** at compile time — decision
trees for instruction selection, optimization passes, and analysis.

```pride
pgen name<TypeConstraints> →
  [bindings : Types] where [conditions] ↦ action
```

```pride
pgen elim_add_zero<T : Numeric> →
  [x : T] where [_ + 0 | 0 + _] ↦ x

pgen mul_to_shift<T : Int> →
  [x : T, n : T] where [x * n, is_power_of_2(n)] ↦ x << log2(n)

pgen select_add_i32 →
  [a : i32, b : i32] where [a + b] ↦ emit_asm("addl %{b:reg}, %{a:reg}")
```

---

## 18. Code Quotation (~Tree, ~Data, ~Bytes)

Three sigils quote an expression as a different representation of the same AST.
They are distinct first-class tokens and each produces its own node kind.

```pride
~Tree  expr    -- expr as an AST node tree (inspect, rewrite, transform)
~Data  expr    -- expr as raw Any-typed data (addressable, serializable)
~Bytes expr    -- expr as a raw byte sequence (u8 slice)
```

```pride
let node = ~Tree (x + y * z)        -- an AST node; pattern-match, apply rules
let code = ~Bytes my_function        -- the function's compiled bytes
let raw  = ~Data  my_vec3f           -- a struct as raw data

comptime
  let folded = ~Tree (1 + 2 + 3) |> arith*   -- at compile time: the integer 6
```

---

## 19. IRDL — IR Dialect Language

IRDL defines **custom IR dialects** for the backend: new opcodes, regions,
edges, and hyperedges that the MSP stage and code generator can recognise and
lower.

```pride
-- declare a dialect with named opcodes
dialect MyDialect
  opcode add_i32
  opcode mul_f32
  region entry
  region exit

-- irdl block: lowering rules from dialect ops to a target
irdl
  MyDialect.add_i32 [a : i32, b : i32] ↦ emit_asm("addl %{b:reg}, %{a:reg}")
```

IRDL keywords: `irdl dialect opcode region block node edge hyperedge graph`.

---

## 20. Metaprogramming (MSP)

The MSP (Meta-Staging / Program) stage runs the metaprogramming constructs over
the AST at compile time. It is modelled on **MetaOCaml's** staging: brackets
(quote), escape (splice/unquote), and run (eval).

```pride
comptime
  let table = build_table(256)       -- evaluated entirely at compile time

stage
  let specialized = splice(generate_code(my_type))

expr |> rules*                       -- apply rules to a fixpoint
```

MSP keywords: `rewrite pgen stage quote splice unquote reify eval comptime
runtime pattern rule fixpoint meta generate lower`.

> **The MSP stage is untyped and unrestricted by design.** Unlike the rest of
> the frontend, it does not enforce types or effects — it can run arbitrary
> compile-time transformations. This is deliberate: the metaprogramming layer is
> where you reach in and reshape the program. The type and effect checkers
> *skip* MSP bodies entirely.

---

## 21. Modules

```pride
-- declare a module (nested modules allowed)
mod math
  fn sin  : f64 → f64 #extern("sin")  #cc(c)
  fn sqrt : f64 → f64 #extern("sqrt") #cc(c)

-- import
use std::mem
use std::io
use math::sin
use math as m

-- qualified access
let s = math::sin(1.0)
let n = m::cos(1.0)
```

The resolver gives each module its own scope, hoists declarations (so mutual
recursion and forward references work), and tracks two namespaces (values and
types) so a name can be both a type and a value.

---

## 22. The AST

Pride's compiler builds a **plain, standard Abstract Syntax Tree** — every node
has exactly one parent: a conventional, debuggable tree.

### 22.1 Node

Every `AstNode` carries:

```
kind            : NodeKind         -- one of ~155 kinds
id              : u32              -- monotonically increasing
line, col       : source location
type_annotation : *AstNode         -- synthesized/declared type (filled by typecheck)
effects         : u64 bitmask      -- EFFECT_* (union of children)
flags           : u32 bitmask      -- mut / folded / range-inclusive / typed / used / ...
resolved        : *AstNode         -- the declaration a name use refers to (filled by resolve)
child_count     : u16
children        : **AstNode        -- arena-allocated
payload union   : literals, operator token, identifier span
```

### 22.2 Arena

The AST lives in a single contiguous bump-allocated slab (64 MB default). All
nodes are bump-allocated; the whole tree is released in one `free` after
codegen. No GC, no per-node frees.

### 22.3 Parse-Time Constant Folding

The parser folds obvious constants immediately:
- `LitInt op LitInt` → folded `LitInt` (or `LitBool` for comparisons),
- `LitBool and/or LitBool` → folded `LitBool`,
- division/modulo by zero → not folded (reported instead).

### 22.4 Node Kind Families

Literals · Names (Ident / TypeVar / Wildcard) · Types (primitive, ptr, ref,
array, slice, tuple, fn, union, intersect, negation, bottom, forall, exists,
generic-app, refinement, **tensor**) · Declarations (let, mut, fn, type, struct,
union, effect, mod, use, const, static) · Statements (return, break, continue,
defer, asm, assume, assert, invariant, unreachable, trap) · Expressions (if,
match, while, for, do-while, block, assign, binary, unary, call, method-call,
field, index, cast, tuple-lit, array-lit, struct-lit, **tensor-lit**, alloc,
free, range, pipeline, sizeof, alignof, transmute, unchecked, **matmul**, unit)
· Patterns · Effects (handle, with, perform, op-decl) · Attributes · Safety/UB
· Metaprogramming · Code quotation sigils · IRDL · SSI (sigma / phi).

---

## 23. Diagnostics and Soft Typing

Pride's analysis passes are **advisory by default**. A type mismatch, an
undeclared effect, a non-exhaustive match, an unused binding — each is a
**warning**, and the compiler continues. This is the "trust the programmer"
half of the philosophy.

```
pride <file.pie>            -- soft mode: warnings, never blocks
pride --strict <file.pie>   -- every warning becomes a hard error (exit 2)
```

The passes and what they catch:

| Pass          | Catches (soft warnings unless `--strict`)                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resolver      | undefined names, duplicate definitions, duplicate pattern binders |
| Type checker  | type mismatches, bad field/index/deref, call arity, generic constraints, tensor shapes, operator domains, mutability |
| Effect checker| effects performed but not declared in the `! [...]` row          |
| Lint          | non-exhaustive match/clauses, unreachable code, unused bindings   |

The frontend is hardened: a recursion-depth guard prevents stack overflow on
pathological nesting, and the whole pipeline is clean under thousands of random
and mutation fuzz inputs, including AddressSanitizer.

## 24. Operator Precedence (High → Low)

```
1.   Postfix:    f()  arr[i]  obj.field  obj.method()  expr?
2.   Prefix:     *p  &x  not x  ¬  ~Tree ~Data ~Bytes  $  `  ~
3.   Cast:       expr as Type
4.   MatMul:     @
5.   Mul:        *  /  %
6.   Add:        +  -
7.   Shift:      <<  >>
8.   Bitwise &:  &
9.   Bitwise ^:  ^
10.  Bitwise |:  |
11.  Compare:    <  >  <=  >=  ==  !=  ≤  ≥  ≠  ∈
12.  Logical &&: and  &&
13.  Logical ||: or   ||
14.  Pipeline:   |>            (with trailing * for fixpoint)
15.  Range:      ..   ..=
16.  Compose:    ++            (rewrite-rule composition)
17.  Assign:     =  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  &=  |=  ^=  <<=  >>=
-- in type position only:
     Arrow →   ·   Type ops ∩ ∪ ¬   ·   Effect row ! [...]   ·   Rewrite ↦
```

Application by juxtaposition (`k v`, `f x`) is used for continuation resumption
and curried calls in clause/handler bodies.
